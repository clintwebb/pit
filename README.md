To display the entries in a group, this accordian method might actually be good.

This one seems better

use this to convert pug to html: https://pughtml.com/


To handle the action messages, Toasts may be appropriate.

To display a group, we can use a Breadcrumb at the top for navigation.
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/breadcrumb/

Then we can have a section for the next lot of Group Folders (Groups should go at the top)
Then the entries in the current group.

Each item can have an icon to indicate what kind of item it is.


Some items should be displayed as monospace text.
<p class="font-monospace">This is in monospace</p>
